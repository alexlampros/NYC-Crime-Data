# NYC Crime Rate Analysis

In this analysis we synthesize NYC crime data with census data, and zillow housing data to understand the effect of crime rates on housing prices at a zip code level. We show that there is a significant negative relationship ( p < 0.0003, R^2 = 0.311) between the trend in crime rate per 100,000 and the percent change in housing prices. On average, if the linear crime rate trend increases by 1 per 100,000 people, this causes the average NYC home to lose $5,312 in value.  Along the way we build a model to predict the profile of a criminal suspect given the profile of a victim.
